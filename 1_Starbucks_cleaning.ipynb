    "## 1.1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I analyze the customer behavior in the Starbucks rewards mobile app. After signing up for the app, customers receive promotions every few days. The task is to identify what customers are influenced by promotional offers the most and what types of offers to send them in order to maximize the revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of promotions:\n",
    "  * discount \n",
    "  * bogo (buy one, get one free)\n",
    "  * informational - product advertisiment without any price off\n",
    "\n",
    "Each offer is valid for certain number of days before it expires. Discounts and bogos have also different difficulty level, depending on how much the customer needs to spend in order to earn the promotion. Promotions are distributed via different multiple channels (social, web, email, mobile).\n",
    "\n",
    "All transactions made through the app are tracked automatically. The app also records information about which offers have been sent, which have been viewed and which have been completed and when these three events happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Dataset Overview\n",
    "The data is organized in three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `portfolio.json` (10 offers x 6 fields) - offer types sent during 30-day test period \n",
    "* `profile.json` (17000 users x 5 fields) - demographic profile of app users \n",
    "* `transcript.json` (306648 events x 4 fields) - event log on transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**portfolio.json**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * id (string) - offer id\n",
    "  * offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational\n",
    "  * difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer\n",
    "  * reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer\n",
    "  * duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days\n",
    "  * channels (list of strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**profile.json**\n",
    "  * age (int) - age of the customer \n",
    "  * became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account\n",
    "  * gender (str) - gender of the customer \n",
    "  * id (str) - customer id\n",
    "  * income (float) - customer's income\n",
    "\n",
    "**transcript.json**\n",
    "  * event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)\n",
    "  * person (str) - customer id\n",
    "  * time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0\n",
    "  * value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to identify target audience for a successful marketing campaign in direct marketing:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Direct marketing describes the marketer's efforts to directly reach the customer through direct marketing communications (direct mail, e-mail, social media, and similar \"personalized\" or one-on-one means). The direct marketiing effort requires marketers to have a target list of customers that will each receive a marketing message tailored to their needs and interests. --- John A. Davis: \"Measuring Marketing\", 3d Edition, 2018, Part 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this task, I decided to use customer segmentation using **K-means clustering technique**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to divide app users into major groups - those more prone to discounts vs. those more keen on bogos vs. those that are not interested in promotions at all. The number of groups was decided at the later stage depending on the actual patterns in the final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4. Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical decision in customer segmentation task is to choose the optimal number of segments. The problem is that unsupervised machine learning doesn't have clearly defined benchmark metrics for model performance evaluation on par with supervised ML (e.g. accuracy score, f1-score, AUC, etc.). Instead there is a number of heuristics that aid analysts during decision-making process, but which ultimately doesn't say anything whether the modeling results are good or bad. For k-means clustering, these heuristics are elbow curve method and silouhette score for deciding upon optimal number of clusters (see section 4.4. for more details). \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the segmentation results, I relied on the following marketing metrics:\n",
    "  * **Response Rate (RR)** - the percentage of customers who viewed an offer relative to the number of customers that received the offer\n",
    "  * **Conversion Rate (CVR)** - the percentage of customers who completed an offer relative to the number of customers who viewed an offer\n",
    "\n",
    "These two marketing metrics helps marketers to improve efficiency and reduce costs of marketing campaign. The response rate tells how many customers are interested in offers, while the conversion rates shows whether the offers sent were attractive enough to complete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calculating each customer's RR and CVR for all bogos, discounts and informational offers sent to him/her, I was able to evaluate the resulting segments in alignment with the project's task, i.e. identify target audience for each promotion type. "
